# Forerel: Real-Time Revenue Forecasting Model with Churn Prediction  

Forerel is a Python-based project designed to address two critical tasks in the telecom industry:  
1. **Churn Prediction**: Identify customers likely to leave the service.  
2. **Revenue Forecasting**: Predict the total revenue generated by customers based on key metrics.

## Features  

- **Synthetic Dataset Generation**:  
  - Realistic Indian telecom service features with meaningful relationships.  

- **Churn Prediction Model**:  
  - Built using a **Random Forest Classifier** to accurately identify customers at risk of churning.  

- **Revenue Forecasting Model**:  
  - Implemented using a **Random Forest Regressor** to estimate customer revenue.  

- **Comprehensive Analytics**:  
  - Model performance metrics including accuracy, precision, recall, RÂ² score, RMSE, and learning curve visualizations.  

- **Robust Pipeline**:  
  - Error handling, detailed logging, and smooth progress tracking using `tqdm`.  

- **Visualization**:  
  - Generate and save plots, such as confusion matrices and learning curves, for better insights.  

- **Modular Codebase**:  
  - Easy to customize and extend.

## Dataset  

The project leverages a dataset tailored for Indian telecom customers. It contains 5,000 rows and 20 columns, including:  
- **Demographics**:  
  - Age, Gender, Region  
- **Financials**:  
  - MonthlyIncome, MonthlySpending  
- **Usage Metrics**:  
  - NetworkQuality, DataUsageGB, CallUsageMin, SMSUsage  
- **Customer Experience**:  
  - CustomerCareCalls, ServiceRating, ChurnRiskScore  
- **Targets**:  
  - Churned (for Churn Prediction), TotalRevenue (for Revenue Forecasting)  

The dataset is stored as `enhanced_telecom_dataset.csv`.
